<h2>Famous Brick Oven Pizza</h2>

<p class="floatRight marginBot">We pride ourselves in our authentic pizza style that we cook in our wood-fired brick oven. Wood-fired brick ovens have been around since the dawn of civilization. Since then, brick ovens have proven to not only provide excellent quality in the food we cook, but they have also been able to stand the test of time. The brick oven reached its most modern form during the age of the ancient Romans. There have even been brick ovens uncovered in the ancient city of Pompeii that are still in great shape. Ovens from the Medieval era can be found throughout Europe, varying in large sizes for lords and smaller versions big enough to cook food for a family. Brick ovens soon began to get more advanced, and in the 1970s the Italian's prefabricated refractory pizza started a brick oven pizza renaissance. Even after the invention of the Americans electric oven, families started returning to the traditional brick oven style of cooking that was passed down from their ancestors. The final step in the evolution of the brick oven came with the development of modern refractory and insulating materials (most ovens today use ceramic insulation). The history behind the brick oven pizza creates a sense of pride in the craft. Some day, we here at Scozy's Pizza, hope to make our own mark on its history and develop a sense of culture and tradition everytime you take that first bite.</p>
